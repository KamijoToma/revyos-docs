# RevyOS

## Introduction

[RevyOS](https://github.com/revyos) is a Debian-optimized custom distribution developed by the RevyOS team, supported by the [RuyiSDK](https://github.com/ruyisdk). 

__RevyOS__ provides comprehensive adaptation and optimization support for chips such as c910v, c920, c906fdv, and c908. It comes pre-integrated with the GCC toolchain supporting RVV0.7.1 and XThead, and utilizes glibc and thead-kernel optimized with the RVV0.7.1 instruction set.

Currently, __RevyOS__ meets basic user needs in office work, web browsing, and video watching.

Based on these customizations and optimizations, __RevyOS__ delivers excellent performance and a great experience on hardware platforms like Lichee Pi 4A, BeagleV-Ahead, and Milk-V Pioneer.
